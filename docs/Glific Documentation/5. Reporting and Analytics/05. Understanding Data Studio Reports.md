Other reports shown in the Flow report section show the no. of messages received for a particular activity request. The data is fetched from `messages` tables for a count of messages in the table and adding a filter on a specific activity and unique contacts. Activities are defined as `labels` in the Big Query table.

For example -

1 . **No. of contacts who requested Help menu** shows how many contacts have sent message **help** over a specific period of time.

2 . **No. of contacts who requested the activity: Poetry** shows how many contacts have sent message **Poetry** over a specific period of time. and so on.

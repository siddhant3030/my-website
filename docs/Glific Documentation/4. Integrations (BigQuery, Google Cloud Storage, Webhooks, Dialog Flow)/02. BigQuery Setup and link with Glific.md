**Before you get started**

Many NGOs are concerned about the cost of setting up BigQuery. They are worried about running up a bill. In reality BigQuery provides a very generous [free tier](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#free-tier) that you will find will suffice for several months. You need not worry till your storage exceeds 10GB and queries 1TB / month !

Google also sends notifications before billing you and provides you mechanisms like quotas to help control price. Learn more about these here :

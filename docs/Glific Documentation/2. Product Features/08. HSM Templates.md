## Suggestions to get the HSM template approved

1. **Avoid doing** - Hi, here are the activities for today. We hope you complete them by the end of the day and submit them.
1. **Instead do** - Hi @nameofperson, following are the activities we have assigned for you and we hope you can complete them and submit them by the end of the day. Thank you.
1. Keeping the **_messages personal and interactive_** with an old beneficiary helps in the approval of the HSM template.
1. GCS **_attachments link should be public_** and working for the beneficiary to access it.
1. **_Use absolute URL_** in HSM text. Short URLs don&#39;t work and the template got rejected with an error message &quot;Invalid format&quot;
1. **Emojis are not allowed** in HSM buttons. If you add emojis the template will be rejected.

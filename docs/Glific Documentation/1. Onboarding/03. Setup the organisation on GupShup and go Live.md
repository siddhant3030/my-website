For a GupShup account, you will also need

1.   [Facebook verification process for WA business API](https://glific.slab.com/public/posts/02-facebook-verification-process-for-wa-business-api-skxjzu85)
1. A new phone number or an phone number that hasn’t been used with WhatsApp(**). The sim card should be activated with a minimal plan so as to receive sms verification code/call from Gupshup

(**) To dis-associate your phone number from WhatsApp you need to open WhatsApp on your phone. Go to Settings → Account → Delete my account. Note - simply uninstalling the app **does not** remove the association between the phone number and WhatsApp.

There are 2 ways to proceed with your gupshup account. You will need to make that choice at step #13 in the documentation below.

1. Traditional Flow : Here is a [video](https://www.gupshup.io/resources/developers/how-to-set-up-your-whatsapp-business-account-and-go-live-with-the-gupshup-traditional-flow) from gupshup  that outlines the process for going live with &quot;Traditional Flow&quot; . You would do this  if you have a _verified Meta Business Manager account_. 
1. FaceBook Embedded Flow : If your Meta Business Account is _not verified_ you may have to choose the &quot;Embedded Flow&quot;. 

Here is useful documentation from [Gupshp.io](https://support.gupshup.io/hc/en-us/articles/360012075939-What-is-required-to-Go-Live-with-my-app-) that helps you understand the difference between the two.

TIP: To check if your Meat Business Manager Account is verified, log in as admin into your Meta/Facebook Business Account at  [business.facebook.com](http://business.facebook.com/). You need to select your business in the dropdown at the top left (it may be default) ; Using the left menu go to Settings-&gt;More Business Settings -&gt;Security Center to check verified status.

**Follow the below steps to create your GupShup account.**

> **Note :-**  _This is a Self-Service step. No need to contact to Gupshup for this. Gupshup may take the route of enterprise Gupshup setup, which is not useful and not required for Glific SAAS service._

1. Go to [https://www.gupshup.io/developer/home](https://www.gupshup.io/developer/home) and signup.  **Note:** Please create an account such that it is shareable with other team members. Because GupShup doesn&#39;t allow multiple team members on one account.

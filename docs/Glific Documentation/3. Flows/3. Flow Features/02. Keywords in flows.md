Keywords are used to start a particular flow from a BOT.

When beneficiary sends a specific word  which is set as keyword for a flow, that particular flow will start and beneficiary will start getting messages from that flow.

Multiple Keywords can be defined with a flow and in different languages. Common keywords used are **Hi**, **Hello**, **Help**, **NGO Org Name,**  etc.. depending on the purpose of the flow.

## How to define a keyword

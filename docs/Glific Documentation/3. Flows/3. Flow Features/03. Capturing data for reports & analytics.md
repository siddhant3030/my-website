While communicating with contacts, data points can be collected and saved. Once done, customised reports can be created from the saved data.

Below is a step by step process to capture the data first.

1. Gather the data points from flows.
1. Save the data with the “Update Contact” function.
1. Check the data field value in BigQuery.
1. Generate chart reports in DataStudio.



Detailed steps to generate the reports.

1. Use `Wait for response` function in flows to gather the data points. Example: capture name of the contact using _contact_name_ field.

1. Save the data with the `Update Contact` node. Use this variable format for the data point   _@results.fieldname.input_ where the fieldname part can change as per your data point. For simplicity, make field name same as Result Name from the above image.

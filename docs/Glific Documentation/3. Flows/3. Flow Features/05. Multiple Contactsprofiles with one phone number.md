It has been observed in some cases, beneficiaries have one phone number and there is more than one person who needs to have their profile created to access the Chat.

In Glific we have introduced a multiple profile feature, which will help more than one person to create their profiles and use the chatbot to access the information with one phone number.

Below are the steps on how to implement multiple profile features in your flow.

## Create New Profile

1 . Create a new flow and ask a question, the contact if he/she wants to create a new profile.

Glific has some predefined variables to use . Refer [Predefined contact variables in Glific](https://glific.slab.com/posts/predefined-contact-variables-in-glific-5q2nb9pr) for details. Organisation can also define their custom variables when needed. **_It is recommended not to have many custom variables defined. Anything under 20 is good number of custom variables._**

## Define custom variables

1 . Create or edit a flow.

2 . In `Wait for response` node define the variable name in `result name` section. In this example variable name is  **schoolname .**

**_(Note: Please use variable name in lowercase and it should be without any space in between two words. You can use underscore &quot;_&quot; if you want to put in the name)._**

## Update contact 

1 . Next to `wait for response` node and another `update contact`node.

2 .  Enter variable name in `Select what to update` section.

We suggest to keep the variable name same to avoid any confusion. You can keep this name different also. **_Note - The value in the update contact will be save with this variable name._**

3 . Enter the syntax of the variable name defined in `wait for response`  section .  It should be written as **@results.variable name**. Like in this example it will be  `@results.schoolname`

4 . If you would like to store the category instead of the value, you can use **@results.variable name.category**. Like in this example it will be `@results.schoolname.category`

There may be a situation, where you want to identify which keyword started a flow or wanted to capture the keyword/sentence contact has sent to start a flow.



You can use `flow_keyword` variables to get the information in the flow.

The syntax will be `@results.flow_keyword.input`

or you can use a `category` to get the whole sentence which contact has entered to start a flow.

The syntax will be `@results.flow_keyword.category`

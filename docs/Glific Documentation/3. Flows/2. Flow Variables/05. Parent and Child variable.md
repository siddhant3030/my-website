In Glific, one flow can be linked to another flow. The main flow in this case is the parent flow and the linked on is the child flow.

Variables defined in Parent flow can be accessed in child flow and vice versa.

In below example, two flows are created.  We will see how to access variables across flows.

1. Parent 
1. Child

## Access variable in child flow, which was defined in parent flow

Parent flow has variable defined with name **state**

1 .  Create a flow (parent).

2 . Define a variable. In this example the variable name is **state**

3 . Call another flow (child)

4 . Access variable created in parent flow.

Syntax to access any variable of parent flow is _@results.parent.variablename_ like in this example the variable name is **state** . The syntax will be **_@results.parent.state.input_**

## Access variable in parent flow , which was defined in child flow.



1 .  Define a variable in child flow. In this example the variable name is **City**

2 . Access the variable in parent flow.

Syntax to access any variable of child flow is _@results.child.variablename_ like in this example the variable name is **city** . The syntax will be

**_@results.child.city.input_**

**Your Parent and Child flows will look like this**

**Parent Flow**

**Child Flow**

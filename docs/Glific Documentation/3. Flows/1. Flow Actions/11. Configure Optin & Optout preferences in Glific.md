When any new beneficiary sends a message the very first time,  the beneficiary can get an Optin message  to give their consent to receive the messages from the BOT.

In Glific NGOs can configure the `optin` and `optout` process in flows.

Glific uses `settings` variable to update the beneficiary&#39;s profile details in the system.

## Here&#39;s  how to configure Optin and Optout in flow.

1 . Create new flow or use the existing flow in the system with name optin and optout.

2 . Craft a message to let the user respond to their optin preference.

## Optout preferences update

5 .  Create a flow for opt-out or use the existing flow in the system. Keywords for Optout flow could be  **optout**, **stop.** _(You can recommend us if you have better suggestions for the keywords)_

6 .  When beneficiary sends    **optout** or **stop**  keyword to BOT, Opt-out preferences will be set for the beneficiary.

7 . Yon need use **optout** value to update the `settings` variable .

**Note** - Make sure to use optin as keyword of this flow. optin is a special keyword which will execute the flow to get contact&#39;s optin even if they are optedout

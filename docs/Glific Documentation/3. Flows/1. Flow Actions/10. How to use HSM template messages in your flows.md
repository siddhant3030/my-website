Common messages used in flow are session messages, which are open to send only within  the 24 hours of users sending a message. If beneficiary responds within 24 hours, the session remains active. After 24 hours NGO users cannot send messages on chat bot to the beneficiary, until they send some message from their WhatsApp.

Remaining hours of session messages expiry can be checked from contact list under search section in left pane.

**Split By Collection** is used in flows, if there is a need to take a decision on the basis of which collection a contact belongs to.

In the below example, we are taking decision in the flow on the basis of which language use has  preferred to use in Glifc.

Let&#39;s say there are two languages to select for contacts (English and Hindi).

1 .   Create a flow

2 .  Ask for the language preferences.

3 . Add contact to the language specific collection.

4 . Do different actions on the basis of which collection a contact belongs to.

There may be situations where you would want to show different responses on the basis of some attribute of contact (which is saved in contact variables by `Update contact` questions type).

You can use the `Split by contact field` option to make that happen.

**Example use case:**  Suppose you want to take a decision on the basis of the age group a contact belongs to.

You need to save the age of the contact in the contact variable before using that in `split by a contact field`

1. Ask contact about their age group.
1. Save the response with `update contact`
1. Select the contact variable from `if the contact's`dropdown and use the response to make a decision in your flow with `split by a contact field`

**Splitting the results on the basis of user responses.**

There may be situations where you would want to show different responses to different flow results

You can use the `Split by a flow result` option to make that happen.



**_Example use case_:** Suppose you have asked a question from the user and based on the result, you want to send the user different responses. `Split by flow result`will help you send different messages for their responses.

1. Get a response from the user in the flow.

2.  Now based on the user response result, show them different options.

3.  In this example if the user choose &quot;Blue&quot;, then the user will see the message of blue color or if the user chooses &quot;Green&quot; then the user will see the message of Green color
